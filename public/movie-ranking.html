<h1>The Best Movies of All Time According to Lawrence</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Grand Budapest Hotel</h3>
<p>It is a super fun movie with whimsy, where the ending doesn't really matter... it is the journey that you fall in love with.<br />
    A classic.</p>

<h3>Samurai Cop</h3>
<p>The best worst movie of all time.<br />Truly awful and truly hilarious</p>

<h3>The Big Lebowski</h3>
<p>Known as a stoner movie, it is a Coen Brothers' classic.<br />I love the strange story, characters and pacing. It is another movie where the ending is somewhat meaningless.<br />It is for sure the journey you will fall in love with.<br />Gets better with each watch!</p>
