<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Born in the &#x1F1EC;&#x1F1E7; <br />
   Living in &#x1F1E7;&#x1F1F7; <br />
</p>

<p>After obtaining a BSc with Honours from The University of Buckingham in Business & Management, I followed a career for over 5 years of
  Loss Adjusting, finding myself specialising in Environmental Insurance claims such as Oil Spillages.
</p>

<p>
  Following this, I entered the cryptocurrency industry, traveling to Brasil and co-founding and leading 'Easy Crypto Brasil', a franchise of New Zealand Exchange, Easy Crypto.
</p>

<p>
  Myself and my co-founder bootstrapped the company and eventually sold to the New Zealand company and I moved from leading Brazil to overseeing all country heads as 'Head of Market Development'.
</p>

<p>
  After a few years with the Easy Crypto Project, I moved over to Bitrefill full time (after having worked there part time on the side of my work at Easy Crypto to earn money and work with a project I loved, which I felt was truly benefiting the world.)
</p>

<p>
  Once at Bitrefill full time I moved away from Marketing and into the Business Development Team, working as a 'Business Development Specialist' for over a year and a half.
</p>
<p>
  Following this, I joined a Product Team as a non-technical Team Lead and currently work in this role maintaining parts of my Business Development responsibilities in addition.
</p>
<p>
  I am learning fullstack development because I want to better understand how projects are truly built and have the power to create at least an MVP for my own projects without needing to rely on others.
